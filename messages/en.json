        "question": "How much do your services cost?",
        "answer": "We can only answer this question after the first consultation. Before we talk about prices, we want to understand exactly what you need. Only then do we calculate a fair flat rate – no hidden costs, no hourly billing. You pay exactly what we agree on together."

        "question": "Do you offer ongoing maintenance?",
