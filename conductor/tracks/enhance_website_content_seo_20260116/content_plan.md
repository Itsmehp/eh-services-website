1.  **Header:**
    *   H1: `Our Work` (or similar, more engaging than "Portfolio")
    *   Sub-heading: A brief, impactful statement about delivering results for clients.
2.  **Filterable Project Grid:**
    *   Retain the category filters (`All`, `WordPress`, `React`, `E-commerce`, `Corporate`).
    *   The grid should display project "cards".
3.  **Project Cards (Update):**

        *   Category Tag (e.g., "E-commerce")
        *   **Key Stat/Result:** A compelling one-liner (e.g., "+200% increase in conversions"). This is crucial for demonstrating value.
        *   "View Case Study" button linking to a detailed project page.
4.  **Case Study Pages (New):**
    *   A new page template is needed for individual case studies (e.g., `/portfolio/mamtapolyfilms`).
